System Entity Structure (SES) is a high-level ontology which was introduced for knowledge representation of decomposition, taxonomy and coupling of systems. It has its roots from the systems theory-based approaches to modeling and simulation. SES has
been applied for various purposes by modeling and simulation community such as creating suites of models for global warming, modeling the elements of a scenario in a research flight simulator or for variant modeling in model-based design.
